# PICO-8 SPL-T

p8spl-t is an attempt at implementing SPL-T in PICO-8.

PICO-8 is a fantasy console (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO-8). SPL-T is an "lo-fi" iOS game from Simogo (https://simogo.com/work/spl-t/) whereby the player attempts to splits as many rectangles as many rectangles as possible. Whenever four similar rectangles are grouped together, they disappear from the game, giving the player points and space to continue to split more rectangles.

SPL-T is ridiculously addictive with a very simple game interface, making it perfect for a beginner game developer like myself, to attempt to port to PICO-8.
